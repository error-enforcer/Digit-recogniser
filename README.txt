Hello if you are reading this, Thank you for downloading my digit recogniser its not perfect as its my first work Ai ever 
and a decent coding project but nonetheless i hope you enjoy it the instructions for this are below:
you can either open jupyter notebook version or the normal python version(recommended)
as of the last update the accuracy is 
1.Open microsoft paint
2. Put it on the left side of the screen (must have 1080p screen otherwise it doesnt work but if you have the technical knowledge you can fix it with a bit of tincering around :))
3. Color background black pick a white brush zoom in so the painting area covers all the edges 
4. Set the brush size to something reasonable ~22-40
5. Run the main file, a window will appear with the real-time prediction

:) 
P.S The dataset is not fully finished it needs about 400 more images to digits such as 5/6/7/8 but it still achieves accuracy score of 0.9711 where 1 is 100%
